# Ruby Linked Lists

## Project Overview
This project is part of The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum. It focuses on implementing one of the fundamental data structures in computer science: the linked list. In this project, I will create a `LinkedList` class and a `Node` class in Ruby, demonstrating an understanding of how linked lists function and how they can be manipulated.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of linked lists as a data structure. By implementing various methods to manipulate linked lists, I will learn about the efficiency and utility of linked lists in different scenarios.

## Key Learning Points
- **Linked List Structure**: Understanding how linked lists store data and how nodes are linked together.
- **Class Implementation**: Developing two classes, `LinkedList` and `Node`, to model the behavior and structure of linked lists.
- **Method Development**: Implementing methods to perform common operations on linked lists.
- **Ruby Programming**: Enhancing Ruby coding skills, focusing on object-oriented programming and data structure manipulation.

## Assignment Details
The assignment involves building the following methods in the `LinkedList` class:

1. `#append(value)`: Adds a new node containing `value` to the end of the list.
2. `#prepend(value)`: Adds a new node containing `value` to the start of the list.
3. `#size`: Returns the total number of nodes in the list.
4. `#head`: Returns the first node in the list.
5. `#tail`: Returns the last node in the list.
6. `#at(index)`: Returns the node at the given index.
7. `#pop`: Removes the last element from the list.
8. `#contains?(value)`: Returns true if the list contains the given value.
9. `#find(value)`: Returns the index of the node containing the value, or nil if not found.
10. `#to_s`: Represents the LinkedList objects as strings in the format: `( value ) -> ( value ) -> ( value ) -> nil`.

### Extra Credit
1. `#insert_at(value, index)`: Inserts a new node with the provided value at the given index.
2. `#remove_at(index)`: Removes the node at the given index.

## Getting Started
To start with this assignment, follow these steps:

1. **Setup**: Clone this repository and set up the Ruby development environment.
2. **Implementation**: Begin by implementing the `Node` class, followed by the `LinkedList` class and its methods.
3. **Testing**: Test each method thoroughly to ensure correct functionality.
4. **Analysis**: Analyze the efficiency of your implementation and understand the practical applications of linked lists.

## Conclusion
This project is a significant step in understanding basic data structures in computer science. Linked lists, while simple, form the foundation for understanding more complex data structures. Through this project, I aim to solidify my understanding of linked lists and their operations, as well as improve my Ruby programming skills.
